     * - parameter until: actually a `while` in disguise, pass a closure that needs to be true for as long as many you want elements
     * - WARNING: Although the name implies that this function takes elements *until* the condition is `true`,
     * it's quite the opposite. Tread carefully when using this function as it does the same job as `prefix(while:)`
     * along with `removeFirst(n:)` with the difference that `prefix(while:)` needs to be converted to array like so:
     * ```
     * let newArray = Array(prefix(while: { /* condition */ }))
     * oldArray.removeFirst(newArray.count)
     * ```
